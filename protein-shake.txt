models
======

- Rethink all your models before making your tables. Think about the constraints
  that your fields are going to have.
- Uniqueness and constraints should be enforced by the database not by logic in
  your code.
- Pay attention to fields in Meta class when creating a model because django uses
  these in various places to do some serious stuff.

=============

- Use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to create separate virtual environments for
  your projects.

- Absolutely use 'south'. It's the best solution for db migrations right now
  till something like this gets into django.
  
- Use 'django-debug-toolbar' for debugging django in development.










pitfalls
========

- get_or_create can create multiple entries in your database if you don't 
  have unique constraints in the database.
